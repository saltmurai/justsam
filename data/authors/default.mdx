Hello, I'm Sang, but you can just called me Sam.

I'm a developer from 🇻🇳.

I recently graduated from [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/en/) with a bachelor's degree in Electronics And Telecommunication.
But tooks an interest in software development and work as a software developer ever since I graduated.
This is my personal site, sharing technical knowledge to help other peers, bits of daily life, and opinions on things.

While not opening VSCode or iterm2. I often spend my time on:

- 🎸 Currently studying Guitar at Hanoi School of Rockk
- 🛼 I do skating (inline), pretty average though.
- 🎮 Grinding games. My current favorite is [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/)
- 📸 Do a bit of photography, my Insta at [saltmurai](https://www.instagram.com/saltmurai/)

Wanna know more? (jk who care that much anyway)

But if you do, feel free to contact me via email or any social media at the bottom of the page 🥂.

Btw did I mention that I like cats 🐈?
